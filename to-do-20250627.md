## To-Do List: Trip Planner Enhancements

### **Bug Fixes**

* **Rating & Type Disappearing:** Fix issue where rating and type are removed from places after clicking hearts or updating duration. Suspect data inconsistency during database update.

### **UI/UX Improvements (Existing Elements)**

* **Place Card (Trip Detail Page):** Display **Google rating + reviews** and **place type** on the place card in the trip detail page, leveraging existing data.

### **New Features**

* **Add Hotel Stay Form:** Implement a **note field** in the "Add Hotel Stay" form. Ensure data consistency across all related components and pages.
* **Activity Card (Editable Note):** Add an **editable note field** to the activity card, similar to how duration is edited. Verify all data is saved correctly.
* **Accommodation Card (Trip Planning Page):** Display additional fields like **note** and **room type** on the accommodation card.
* **Activity Card (Trip Planning Page):** Display the new **note** field on the activity card.
* **Edit Hotel Information:** Enable users to **edit hotel information** on the trip planning page, similar to the "Edit Flight" functionality.
### **Ideas for Future Development**

* **Persistent Map Pins for Itinerary Items:** Explore keeping map pins for places dropped into the daily itinerary. The pin could change to a Google Maps landmark icon. Conversely, pins should be removed if the place is removed from the itinerary.
* **Map Center Reset on Card Click:** Investigate resetting the map's center when a place or accommodation card in the daily itinerary is clicked, to automatically highlight its location.
