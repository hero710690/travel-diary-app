## üìã Recent Changes (2025-06-26)

### ‚úÖ **TripDetailPage Date-Based Day Calculation Fix**
- **Issue**: Strange day calculation logic causing items to appear on wrong days (e.g., hotel on 2025-09-25 appearing on Day 5 instead of Day 2)
- **Root Cause**: TripDetailPage used sequential assignment (`index + 1`) for non-flight items instead of date-based calculation
- **Problem**: Items with `daysDiff: 1` were assigned to `Day 5` based on array index rather than actual date
- **Example**: Hotel on 2025-09-25 (1 day after trip start) was assigned Day 5 because it was the 5th item in array
- **Implementation**: 
  - Removed problematic sequential assignment logic
  - Applied date-based calculation (`daysDiff + 1`) to ALL items consistently
  - Simplified logic to use actual dates instead of array positions
  - Enhanced debugging to show calculation method used
  - Maintained deduplication logic to handle duplicate entries properly
- **User Experience**: All items now appear on their correct dates based on actual timestamps
- **Bundle Impact**: Small decrease of 7 bytes due to simplified logic
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - all items now use consistent date-based day calculation

### ‚úÖ **TripDetailPage UTC Consistency Fix** (Earlier today)
- **Issue**: Same timezone day calculation issues affecting TripDetailPage as TripPlanningPage
- **Root Cause**: TripDetailPage had its own manual date calculation logic instead of using UTC-consistent utilities
- **Problem**: Flight items and activities appearing on wrong days due to timezone conversion during day calculation
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added import for `safeParseDate` and `getDaysDifferenceIgnoreTime` UTC utilities
  - Replaced manual date parsing with UTC-consistent `safeParseDate` function
  - Updated day calculation to use `getDaysDifferenceIgnoreTime` instead of manual UTC date creation
  - Enhanced debugging to show both UTC and local date representations
  - Fixed date parsing in `generateDays` function for trip date range calculation
  - Updated itinerary date range calculation to use UTC-safe parsing
- **User Experience**: Flight items and activities now appear on correct days in trip detail view
- **Bundle Impact**: Small increase of 97 bytes for UTC consistency improvements
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - TripDetailPage now uses same UTC-consistent logic as TripPlanningPage

### ‚úÖ **Flight Day Display Fix** (Earlier today)
- **Issue**: Flight saved correctly in DB as "2025-09-24T19:15:00.000Z" but displayed on wrong day (2025-09-25)
- **Root Cause**: `getDaysDifferenceIgnoreTime` function used local timezone methods instead of UTC methods
- **Problem**: Day calculation for loaded items used `getFullYear()`, `getMonth()`, `getDate()` causing timezone shifts
- **Implementation**: 
  - Fixed `getDaysDifferenceIgnoreTime` to use UTC methods (`getUTCFullYear()`, `getUTCMonth()`, `getUTCDate()`)
  - Updated day calculation to be consistent with UTC date handling
  - Enhanced debugging to show both UTC and local date representations
  - Ensured all date calculations use UTC to avoid timezone conversion issues
- **User Experience**: Flights now appear on the correct day in the trip planning interface
- **Bundle Impact**: Small increase of 38 bytes for improved UTC date handling
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - flights now display on the correct day matching their actual date

### ‚úÖ **Flight Card Preservation Fix** (Earlier today)
- **Issue**: Flight cards were disappearing after saving itinerary due to timezone conversion problems
- **Root Cause**: Flight items were being processed through the same timezone conversion logic as regular activities
- **Problem**: Flight dates were being incorrectly calculated (e.g., 2025-09-26T19:15:00.000Z instead of proper arrival time)
- **Implementation**: 
  - Removed problematic `date` field from flight item creation
  - Modified save function to handle flights separately from regular activities
  - Used flight's own arrival date/time from `flightInfo` instead of `combineDateAndTime`
  - Added enhanced debugging for flight save/load operations
  - Preserved all `flightInfo` data during save/load cycle
- **User Experience**: Flight cards now persist correctly after saving itinerary
- **Bundle Impact**: Small increase of 41 bytes for improved flight handling
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - flight cards now maintain their data and display correctly

### ‚úÖ **Timezone Consistency Fix for DateTime Fields** (Earlier today)
- **Issue**: DateTime fields were inconsistent due to timezone conversion problems
- **Problem**: Adding a place at 9:00 AM on 2025-09-24 was stored as "2025-09-23T16:00:00.000Z"
- **Root Cause**: Local timezone dates being converted to UTC incorrectly during save operations
- **Implementation**: 
  - Fixed `addDaysToDate` function to work consistently with UTC dates
  - Updated `safeParseDate` to parse YYYY-MM-DD dates as UTC (adding 'T00:00:00.000Z')
  - Added new `combineDateAndTime` utility function for proper datetime combination
  - Updated save operations to use combined UTC datetime instead of separate date/time fields
  - Enhanced debug logging to track timezone conversion issues
- **User Experience**: DateTime fields now maintain consistency across all operations
- **Bundle Impact**: Small increase of 77 bytes for improved date handling utilities
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - dates and times now stored correctly in UTC without timezone shifts

### ‚úÖ **User Interest Rating Feature (1-5 Stars)** (Earlier today)
- **Change**: Added star rating functionality to place cards for user interest tracking
- **Reason**: Allow users to mark their level of interest (1-5 stars) on places in their wishlist

  - Enhanced DraggablePlace component with interactive star rating UI
  - Added hover effects and visual feedback for star selection
  - Implemented `handleUpdatePlaceInterest` function in TripPlanningPage
  - Used both outline and solid star icons for better visual distinction
  - Added click handlers with event propagation prevention to avoid drag conflicts
- **User Experience**: Users can now rate places 1-5 stars to track their interest level
- **Bundle Impact**: Moderate increase of 479 bytes for star rating functionality
- **Data Structure**: Updated Place interface with optional `userInterestRating?: number` field

### ‚úÖ **Icon Buttons for Edit/Remove Actions** (Earlier today)
- **Change**: Updated FlightCard edit and remove buttons to use pencil and trash icons
- **Reason**: Improved visual consistency and modern UI design
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added PencilIcon and TrashIcon imports to FlightCard
  - Replaced text-based "Edit" and "Remove" buttons with icon buttons
  - Added hover effects and tooltips for better UX
  - Maintained existing functionality while improving visual design
- **User Experience**: Cleaner, more intuitive interface with consistent iconography
